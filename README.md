# 🧃 Texture Packer — ORM Map Generator

**Texture Packer** is a simple tool designed for 3D artists and game modders. It helps you **combine three texture maps** (Ambient Occlusion, Roughness, and Metallic) into a single **ORM texture** used in game engines like Unreal Engine and Unity.

No coding skills required. Just drag your textures into a folder and run the packer!

## 🧩 What is an ORM Texture?

An ORM (Occlusion-Roughness-Metallic) texture combines:

- **Red channel**: Ambient Occlusion (AO)  
- **Green channel**: Roughness  
- **Blue channel**: Metallic  

Game engines use these combined textures to save memory and optimize performance.

## 🎨 How to Use

### 1. 💾 Prepare Your Textures

Put all your textures in one folder. Name them using a clear suffix like:

MyModel_ao.png
MyModel_roughness.png
MyModel_metallic.png


You can also use alternative endings like:

MyModel_ambient_occlusion.png
MyModel_rough.png



The tool lets you configure these suffixes.

### 2. ⚙️ Choose Your Settings

When you launch the app:

1. **Select the folder** with your textures.  
2. **Set suffixes** for AO, Roughness, and Metallic maps. Example:  
   - AO: `ao,ambient_occlusion`  
   - Roughness: `rough,roughness`  
   - Metallic: `metal,metallic`  
3. (Optional) Enable additional features:  
   - 🌙 **Dark Theme** — easier on the eyes in low-light environments  
   - 📄 **Log to File** — save the report to a `.txt` file  
   - 🔊 **Sound on Finish** — helpful for large batches; get notified when it's done  
   - 🗑️ **Delete Obsolete Textures** — automatically remove source AO, Roughness, and Metallic textures after packing

---

### 3. 🚀 Start Packing

Click the **Start** button and let the tool do its magic.

It will check if all required maps are available for each model and create a new `*_ORM.png` file in the same folder.

Example output:


MyModel_ORM.png

## ✅ Features

- Supports **.png** and **.jpg** formats  
- Accepts **multiple suffix names** per map

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

- **Missing maps?**  
  Make sure your textures use the correct suffixes (e.g., `ao`, `roughness`, `metallic`).

- **Different image sizes?**  
  All three maps must be the same size. Resize them in Photoshop or any image editor.

- **Nothing happens?**  
  Check the log file (if enabled) for skipped files or errors.

## 🙋 FAQ

### Can I use other suffixes like `_occlusion` or `_met`?
Yes! Just type your preferred endings in the suffix settings, separated by commas.

Example:

AO: ao,ambient_occlusion,occlusion
Metallic: metallic,metal,met


---

### Does it overwrite original textures?
No, the tool only creates new `*_ORM.png` files. Your original textures are safe.
